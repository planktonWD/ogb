###Welcome to Mike Storys Boilerplate###
This unstyled modular framework is based entirely on <a href="https://github.com/inuitcss/">inuitcss</a> and follows the BEM naming convention

Above are the folders inside the ui directory demoing the styleguide

There are also links below detailing some of the themes built with it that might be useful.

I hope this documentation makes this framework easy to work with!

email me with questions or feedback. michael@michaelstory.co.nz

###This styleguide uses jeckyll and grunt###
